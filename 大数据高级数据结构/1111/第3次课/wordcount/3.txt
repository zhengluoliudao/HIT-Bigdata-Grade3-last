The buccaneers now bestirred themselves to finish the two small vessels on which the carpenters had been for some time at work In a fortnight they were ready for sea armed and provided with the Kings cannon munitions and stores Trenchant an excellent pilot was forced to join the party Their favorite object was the plunder of a certain church on one of the Spanish islands which they proposed to assail during the midnight mass of Christmas whereby a triple end would be achieved: first a rich booty; secondly the punishment of idolatry; thirdly vengeance on the archenemies of their party and their faith They set sail on the eighth of December taunting those who remained calling them greenhorns and threatening condign punishment if on their triumphant return they should be refused free entrance to the fort
They were no sooner gone than the unfortunate Laudonniere was gladdened in his solitude by the approach of his fast friends Ottigny and Arlac who conveyed him to the fort and reinstated him The entire command was reorganized and new officers appointed The colony was wofully depleted; but the bad blood had been drawn off and thenceforth all internal danger was at an end In finishing the fort in building two new vessels to replace those of which they had been robbed and in various intercourse with the tribes far and near the weeks passed until the twentyfifth of March when an Indian came in with the tidings that a vessel was hovering off the coast Laudonniere sent to reconnoitre The stranger lay anchored at the mouth of the river She was a Spanish brigantine manned by the returning mutineers starving downcast and anxious to make terms Yet as their posture seemed not wholly pacific Landonniere sent down La Caille with thirty soldiers concealed at the bottom of his little vessel Seeing only two or three on deck the pirates allowed her to come alongside; when to their amazement they were boarded and taken before they could snatch their arms Discomfited woebegone and drunk they were landed under a guard Their story was soon told Fortune had flattered them at the outset and on the coast of Cuba they took a brigantine laden with wine and stores Embarking in her they next fell in with a caravel which also they captured Landing at a village in Jamaica they plundered and caroused for a week and had hardly reembarked when they met a small vessel having on board the governor of the island She made a desperate fight but was taken at last and with her a rich booty They thought to put the governor to ransom but the astute official deceived them and on pretence of negotiating for the sum demandedtogether with "four or six parrots and as many monkeys of the sort called sanguins which are very beautiful" and for which his captors had also bargainedcontrived to send instructions to his wife Hence it happened that at daybreak three armed vessels fell upon them retook the prize and captured or killed all the pirates but twentysix who cutting the moorings of their brigantine fled out to sea Among these was the ringleader Fourneaux and also the pilot Trenchant who eager to return to Fort Caroline whence he had been forcibly taken succeeded during the night in bringing the vessel to the coast of Florida Great were the wrath and consternation of the pirates when they saw their dilemma; for having no provisions they must either starve or seek succor at the fort They chose the latter course and bore away for the St Johns A few casks of Spanish wine yet remained and nobles and soldiers fraternizing in the common peril of a halter joined in a last carouse As the wine mounted to their heads in the mirth of drink and desperation they enacted their own trial One personated the judge another the commandant; witnesses were called with arguments and speeches on either side
